## Code is a powerful tool!

I'm Tom, living in Paris, France.

👨‍💻 I've been passionate about coding since I was a child, and I've always done little projects, game, apps...

🎨 I enjoy coding creative stuff, such as animations, web/mobile design, and random art generation.

🏀 I play basketball as well :)
