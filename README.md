## Code is a powerful tool!

I'm Tom, living in Paris, France.
I'm a student of school 42, and I've been freelancing for consulting firms and startups.

I'm currently working full-time on capsa.finance, a crypto hedge fund.

👨‍💻  I've been passionate about coding since I was a child, and I've always done little projects, game, apps...

📈  I've a strong interest for quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, AI trading and cryptos.

🎨  I enjoy coding creative stuff, such as animations, web/mobile design, and random art generation.
